![Angular Feed](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nodesman/angularfeed/master/ux/angularfeed.png)

My implementation of a feed reader using AngularJs. It uses local storage to store your subscriptions. Subscribe to an almost unlimited number of feeds. Organize them under folders and read your feeds in a segmented fashion.
