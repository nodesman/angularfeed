# Rails Anuglar Feed
================

My implementation of a feed reader using AngularJs. It uses local storage to store your subscriptions. Subscribe to an almost unlimited number of feeds. organize them under folders and read your feeds in a segmented fashion. 

This will evolve to have a user account system so that you can carry your subscriptions around.
